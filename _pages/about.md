I'm Lisa, a software engineer at GoCardless.

I started out as a consultant working with HMRC and then smart meters, before accidentally becoming a developer.

I love building stuff, but am also interested in how people interact with each other in a work environment - particularly in software engineering.
Having seen the 'old way' at Accenture (large-scale waterfall projects), I think it's interesting to try and bring some thinking from that 
environment into an Agile Startup.

Outside of work, I love cooking and pretty much any competitive sport (well, the British ones anyway).
