Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lisa, an engineer at [incident.io](https://incident.io).

I started out as a consultant working at Accenture, before accidentally becoming a developer.
I cut my teeth as an IC and then Tech Lead at GoCardless, and then couldn't say no to the chance to join incident.io as employee #2.

I love building stuff, but am also interested in how people interact with each other in a work environment - particularly in software engineering.
Having seen the 'old way' at Accenture (large-scale waterfall projects), I think it's interesting to try and bring some thinking from that 
environment into a startup.

Outside of work, I love cooking and pretty much any competitive sport (well, the British ones anyway).
