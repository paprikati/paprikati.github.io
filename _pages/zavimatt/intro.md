title: Zavi & Matt's Afternoon of Games

Hi Zavi and Matt!

Welcome to your afternoon of games. We hope you enjoy it.
Each game has been created by someone who loves you.

You can now open the bag. Find envelope A and open it.

To find the games that your friends have created, you must
first decipher the quotes in the envelope.
Some are from fictional characters, some from real characters.
You must work out the original quote, and use the initials of the
person that said it in the url. If it's from a film, we want the
character not the actor.

For example, if the puzzle said 'honestly darling, I do not care' meaning 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn',
the answer would be 'RB' (Rhett Butler) who is the *character* who says that line.
Then you'd go to https://paprikati.github.io/zavimatt/rb to find your
next puzzle. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to call or message us to help you out.

Once you've done all 6, let me know and I'll direct you to your prize.
